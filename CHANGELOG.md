# Changelog

All notable changes to `dcardenasl/ci4-api-core` will be documented here. Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versioning follows [SemVer](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.0] — 2026-07-23

### Added

- **`Support\JsonCastNormalizer::toArray()`** — normalizes a value decoded from a CI4 Entity `json` cast into a plain, fully-array structure. CI4's `json` cast decodes to `stdClass` recursively at every nesting level, not just the top one; a naive `(array) $value` only casts the top level and silently leaves nested values as `stdClass`, which then fail `is_array()` checks downstream without raising an error. Round-trips through `json_encode()`/`json_decode(..., true)` to normalize every level at once.

### Fixed

- **`BaseRequestDTO` — false-positive validation on empty-array wildcard fields** — CodeIgniter's Validation engine can't tell "zero items to expand a wildcard rule over" apart from "field is missing entirely": for a field like `items.*.id` with `items` absent or present-but-empty, it synthesizes a single phantom value keyed by the literal, unexpanded field name and runs the per-item rules against it, so a rule like `required_with[items]` wrongly treats that synthetic `null` as "items is present" and fails even though there's nothing to violate. `BaseRequestDTO::validate()` now drops a wildcard rule entirely when its base field isn't a non-empty array before handing rules to the validator, sidestepping the framework's fallback. Rules with no wildcard children, and wildcard rules over arrays that do have items, are untouched.
- **`Repositories\RepositoryInterface::findAll()` / `BaseRepository::findAll()`** — changed the `$limit` parameter from `int $limit = 0` to `?int $limit = null`, matching CI4's own `Model::findAll()` convention. The old `0` default was a landmine: any consumer app with `Config\Feature::$limitZeroAsAll = false` (both `ci4-website-builder-api` and `-domain` set this) would see `findAll()` called with no arguments silently return **zero rows** instead of "all records", because `0` was forwarded straight into CI4's ambiguous `limit(0)` semantics. `null` is unambiguous regardless of that config toggle. No call site in the consumer apps was passing default args at the time of the fix, so this closes the gap before it caused a real bug.

## [1.0.1] — 2026-06-10

### Fixed

- **`Filters\QueryBuilder`** — correct config key from `searchEnabled` to `searchUseFulltext` when reading fulltext search toggle from `ApiConfigFacade`.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-06-04

### Added

- **`HubClient::registerSelfPermissions()`** — new method that calls `POST /api/v1/iam/self-permissions` using only the domain's X-App-Key (no superadmin JWT). Returns a summary `{created, existing, rejected, errors}`. Domain apps use this for canonical permission registration so `application_id` is resolved from the key, not from JWT context.
- **`HubClientConfig::$selfPermissionsPath`** — new config field defaulting to `/api/v1/iam/self-permissions`.

## [0.9.3] — 2026-06-01

### Changed

- **`HubClient::registerPermission()`** — enhanced to accept optional `applicationId` parameter, enabling domain apps to register permissions scoped to their own application in the hub. Backward compatible; existing calls work unchanged.

## [0.9.2] — 2026-05-29

### Fixed

- **`Exceptions\BaseExceptionHandler`** — corrected method signature to match CI4's `ExceptionHandlerInterface` (`handle(Throwable, RequestInterface, ResponseInterface, int, int): void`). The previous signature (`handle(Throwable): ResponseInterface`) was incompatible with the interface, making any consumer subclass silently non-functional as a CI4 exception handler.

### Removed

- **`Http\HealthCheckController`** — removed from core. The controller had app-specific logic requirements (audit config awareness, disk-pressure policy) that cannot be satisfied by a generic base. `Monitoring\HealthChecker` remains in core; consumers implement their own controller extending CI4's `Controller`.

## [0.9.1] — 2026-05-29

### Added

- **`Http\HealthCheckController`** — standard health check controller delegatable from consumer projects; exposes `GET /health` reporting database, disk space, and (if available) Redis status.
- **`Exceptions\BaseExceptionHandler`** — abstract base class consumers extend to implement CI4's `Config\Exceptions::handler()` contract for uniform exception mapping.
- **`Dto\ApiResponseDTO`**, **`Dto\CollectionResponseDTO`**, **`Dto\ErrorResponseDTO`** — generic typed response DTOs for standardised API response envelopes.

## [0.9.0] — 2026-05-28

### Added

- **`Http\Client\HubClient`** — concrete, shared hub HTTP client implementing `Contracts\HubClientInterface` on top of `AbstractServiceClient`. Carries the four hub operations (`introspect`, `getServiceToken`, `registerPermission`, `getUser`) previously duplicated — with latent drift — in `ci4-bff-starter` and `ci4-domain-starter`. The BFF now resolves this class directly; domain apps subclass it to add hub endpoints exposed only to them (IAM role management). Closes the HubClient half of the BFF duplication audit (BFF-M1).
- **`Http\Client\HubClientConfig`** — immutable value object (url, apiKey, endpoint paths, TTLs, timeout) that decouples `HubClient` from a consumer's framework `Config\Hub`. Consumers map their config into it inside the `Services::hubClient()` factory, so core depends only on this package.

### Changed

- **Dev tooling aligned with the rest of the platform:** `phpunit/phpunit` `^10.5` → `^11.0` (suite migrated off deprecated doc-comment metadata to PHPUnit attributes) and `phpstan/phpstan` `^2.0` → `^2.1`.

## [0.8.0] — 2026-05-27

### Added

- **`Http\Filters\Concerns\RateLimitResponseHelpers`** — trait that centralises rate-limit header attachment (`X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, `X-RateLimit-Reset`) and the `429 Too Many Requests` response. Extracted from duplicated implementations in consumer throttle filters; `AbstractThrottleFilter` now uses it directly.
- **`app_id` awareness** — `ApiRequest::setAppId()/getAppId()` and `SecurityContext::$app_id` expose the application identifier resolved from an API key. Consumers that resolve an application from the incoming request can now propagate it through the security context without custom subclasses.
- `RepositoryInterfaceTest` and `AuditServiceInterfaceTest` added to the Unit suite, covering the generic contracts introduced in this release.

### Changed

- **Generic typing across repositories and services** — `RepositoryInterface`, `BaseRepository`, `GenericRepository`, `AuditRepositoryInterface`, `PivotRepositoryInterface`, `AuditService`, `NullAuditService`, `AuditServiceInterface`, `BaseCrudService`, and `RequestAuditContextFactory` now carry explicit generic type parameters. PHPStan level-8 consumers benefit immediately; no runtime behaviour changes.
- **`ApiController` and `ApiResponse` typing tightened** — return types and generics aligned with the repository/service layer. No behavioural changes.
- **CodeIgniter 4 updated to v4.7.3** (`composer.lock`).

## [0.7.2] — 2026-05-24

### Changed

- README status badge updated from `v0.6.x` to `v0.7.x`; install examples updated to `^0.7`.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-05-22

### Added

- `RepositoryInterface::findBy(string $column, mixed $value): ?object` and its implementation in `BaseRepository`. Provides a type-safe single-record lookup by any column without exposing the raw query builder. Eliminates the `getModel()->where()->first()` workaround that PHPStan level 8 rejects.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-05-20

### Added

- **`Http\Client\IntrospectResult`** — canonical value object for `/api/v1/auth/introspect` responses (`valid`, `uid`, `permissions[]`, `exp`, `error`). Promoted from verbatim copies in `ci4-bff-starter` and `ci4-domain-starter`; both now import from this package.
- **`Http\Filters\AbstractIntrospectionFilter`** — abstract auth filter for BFF and domain apps that delegate JWT validation to a hub introspect endpoint. Subclasses implement only `introspect(string $token): IntrospectResult`; Bearer extraction, context population, and 401 responses are handled by the parent `AbstractJwtAuthFilter`. Reduces `DomainAuthFilter` from 77 lines to ~12 lines of custom code.
- **`Contracts\HubClientInterface`** — contract for hub HTTP clients (`introspect`, `getServiceToken`, `registerPermission`, `getUser`). Both `ci4-bff-starter` and `ci4-domain-starter` `HubClient` implementations now declare this interface.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-05-17

### Changed

- **CodeIgniter requirement widened to `^4.7`** — locks the package to CI4 4.7.x (current stable, v4.7.2). CI4 4.6.x is no longer accepted; consumers on 4.6 must upgrade before pulling this version. README requirements and the scaffolding compatibility matrix updated accordingly.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-05-16

This release introduces a generic outbound HTTP base class for service-to-service calls — the foundation for the new BFF gateway and domain app's hub clients — plus optional Sentry breadcrumb observability. All changes are additive; no breaking changes for existing consumers.

### Added

- **`Http\Client\AbstractServiceClient`** — generic base for service-to-service HTTP calls. Two operation modes:
  - `request(method, path, options)` returns the decoded JSON `data` payload or throws a canonical `ApiException` subtype. Suitable for typed client wrappers (e.g. a `HubClient` that returns DTOs).
  - `forward(method, path, options)` returns the upstream `ResponseInterface` untouched. Suitable for transparent proxy controllers (e.g. a BFF gateway endpoint).

  Built-in behaviour: 1× retry on 5xx and network errors with linear backoff; automatic propagation of `X-Request-Id` from `RequestIdHolder`; `Accept: application/json` by default; `http_errors=false`; canonical mapping of upstream status codes to `ApiException` subtypes (400 → `BadRequestException`, 401 → `AuthenticationException`, 403 → `AuthorizationException`, 404 → `NotFoundException`, 409 → `ConflictException`, 422 → `ValidationException`, 429 → `TooManyRequestsException`, 5xx/network → `ServiceUnavailableException`). Subclasses inject the upstream base URL via the constructor and may override the header allow-list and breadcrumb hook.
- **`Config\Api` outbound HTTP knobs** — `outboundHttpTimeout` (default `5` seconds), `outboundHttpRetries` (default `1`), `outboundHttpRetryDelayMs` (default `250` ms). Each is overridable via env (`OUTBOUND_HTTP_TIMEOUT`, `OUTBOUND_HTTP_RETRIES`, `OUTBOUND_HTTP_RETRY_DELAY_MS`).
- **`AbstractServiceClient::recordBreadcrumb()`** hook — invoked after every dispatch attempt (including network errors → `status: null`). Default implementation forwards to `\Sentry\addBreadcrumb()` when the function is available; no-op otherwise. Level `warning` for 5xx/network failures, `info` for 2xx–4xx responses. Subclasses can override to forward to OpenTelemetry or any other tracer without modifying `dispatch()`.
- **`sentry/sentry`** added to `composer suggest` — required only if you want Sentry breadcrumbs from `AbstractServiceClient`; the hook is a no-op when the SDK is absent.

### Changed

- **README** — sharpened intro ("Production-ready REST API foundation … without writing boilerplate"), added Packagist version + download badges, and a dedicated "Example Project" section linking to `dcardenasl/ci4-api-core-example` (the runnable Catalog API reference).
- **Packagist keywords expanded** — `composer.json` now declares `codeigniter`, `ci4`, `rest-api`, `dto-first`, `audit`, `queue`, `repository-pattern`, `service-layer` in addition to the existing set, improving discoverability on Packagist search.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-05-10

### Added

- **`core:install` now injects `GET /health` into `app/Config/Routes.php`** — on first run the command appends a health route backed by `HealthChecker` (returns JSON with individual check results + overall `healthy`/`degraded`/`unhealthy` status; 200 or 503). Idempotent via `// ci4-api-core: health route start/end` markers; fail-safe when `/health` already exists without the marker (prints recovery snippet instead of overwriting). The `validate` step at the end of `core:install` now also verifies this marker is present.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-09

This release tightens the boundary between **runtime foundation** (this package) and **CRUD scaffolding** (`ci4-api-scaffolding`), externalises consumer-specific knobs that were hardcoded in core helpers, and publishes generic abstract bases for HTTP filters and IAM that consumers can extend instead of reimplementing. `ci4-api-core` remains autonomous — installable and usable without `ci4-api-scaffolding`.

### Breaking changes

- **`AuditService` no longer hardcodes entity-type aliases** — the previous `'user' => 'users'`, `'api-key' => 'api_keys'`, `'file' => 'files'` mapping is now read from `Config\Audit::$entityTypeAliases` (default: empty array). Consumers that depend on the legacy mapping must declare it in their own `app/Config/Audit.php`.
- **`AuditService::enrichEntities()` actor table is now configurable via `Config\Audit`** — `actorTable`, `actorEmailColumn`, `actorNameColumns`, `actorTargetPrefix`. Defaults preserve the previous behaviour (`users` / `email` / `[first_name, last_name]` / `user`), so consumers using a `users` table are unaffected. Consumers with a different actor schema should override these in their `app/Config/Audit.php`.
- **`RelationLabelLoader::attachUserLabels()` is deprecated** in favour of the generic `attachActorLabels(entities, sourceField, table, emailColumn?, nameColumns?, targetPrefix?, relatedKey?)`. The deprecated method delegates to the generic one with the legacy `users`/`email`/`first_name,last_name`/`user` arguments. Will be removed in v1.0.

  **Migration** — replace any call to `attachUserLabels()` with the explicit form:
  ```php
  // Before (deprecated):
  $loader->attachUserLabels($entities, 'user_id');

  // After:
  $loader->attachActorLabels(
      entities:      $entities,
      sourceField:   'user_id',
      relatedTable:  'users',
      emailColumn:   'email',
      nameColumns:   ['first_name', 'last_name'],
      targetPrefix:  'user',
  );
  ```
  The attached fields (`user_email`, `user_full_name`, `user_label`) are identical; only the call site changes.
- **`CoreInstall` is now idempotent and fail-safe** — wiring writes are bracketed by `// ci4-api-core: <section> start/end` markers; re-running the command is a no-op when those markers exist. A `Services.php.bak` backup is written before any modification. If the file is hand-edited or non-standard (anchors not found), the command refuses to write and prints a recovery snippet instead of corrupting the file. The previous "also generate Config/Scaffolding.php if scaffolding is installed" branch is removed (cross-package responsibility); use `dcardenasl\Ci4ApiScaffolding\Commands\ScaffoldCheck` and copy the bundled `docs/Scaffolding.php.example` instead.

### Added

- **`Http\Filters\AbstractJwtAuthFilter`** — generic Bearer-token authentication filter with template-method hooks (`decodeToken` *required*; `extractBearerToken`, `shouldCheckRevocation`, `isTokenRevoked`, `loadActor`, `requireActorOnUserToken`, `assertAccessPolicy`, `accessPolicyBypassRoutes`, `getSecurityAuditLogger`, `getRequestAuditContextFactory`). Consumers extend this and provide their JWT/user-loading concretions.
- **`Http\Filters\AbstractPermissionFilter`** — generic `permission:<code>` filter that reads scope from `ApiRequest`/`ContextHolder`. Subclasses inject the consumer's `SecurityAuditLoggerInterface`.
- **`Http\Filters\AbstractThrottleFilter`** — generic per-bucket rate limiter (IP + user buckets by default) with a `resolveBuckets()` hook for app-aware overrides (e.g. API-key-based limits).
- **`Contracts\Iam\PermissionResolverInterface`** — contract for resolving `(user_id, application_id) → list<string>` permission codes. Consumers may back this with any storage (DB, Redis, remote IAM hub).
- **`Contracts\Iam\ApplicationPermissionResolverInterface`** — contract for resolving `application_id → list<string>` codes (used by service/M2M tokens).
- **`Contracts\SecurityAuditLoggerInterface`** — contract consumed by the new abstract filters (`logAuthorizationDeniedFromRequest`, `logAuthorizationDeniedFromContext`, `logRevokedTokenReuse`).
- **`Services\Iam\AbstractIamAuthorizationService`** — hierarchical authorization rules (`assertNotSelf`, `isSuperAdmin`, `actorPermissions`, `assertCanGrantPermissions/Roles`, `assertCanModifyRole`, `assertCanActOnSubject`, `assertSuperAdmin`) with three storage hooks (`loadRoleSystemFlag`, `resolvePermissionCodes`, `resolveRolePermissionCodes`). The superadmin permission code, default application id, and i18n key prefix are all overrideable via hook methods.
- **`Commands\EnvCheck`** — bundled spark command. Validates required env vars, secret strength (`JWT_SECRET_KEY` ≥ 64 bytes, `encryption.key` ≥ 32 bytes), and production-only requirements (`CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`). Subclassable via `protected` properties (`$required`, `$recommended`, `$secrets`) and the `minSecretLength()` hook.
- **`Commands\QueueWork`** — bundled spark command. Generic worker for the bundled `QueueManager` (`--once`, `--queue`, `--max-jobs`, `--sleep`, `--job-delay`).
- **`Config\Api` is now heredable** with `protected envValue()` and a self-hydrating `__construct()`. Consumers can extend via `class Api extends \dcardenasl\Ci4ApiCore\Config\Api { ... }` instead of copying every field. Falls back to declared defaults when run outside CI4 bootstrap (tests). Set `protected bool $hydrateFromEnv = false` in a subclass to keep declared defaults exactly.
- **`Config\Audit::$entityTypeAliases`** plus actor-table metadata properties (`actorTable`, `actorEmailColumn`, `actorNameColumns`, `actorTargetPrefix`).
- **`composer analyse:baseline`** script for emitting `phpstan-baseline.neon`.
- **`php spark core:install`** wiring command (was previously [Unreleased] under v0.3 — now hardened with markers, backup, idempotency, and fail-safe; no longer touches scaffolding config).
- **`NullAuditService`** — no-op `AuditServiceInterface` implementation (was previously [Unreleased]).
- **Package-owned `Config/` and `Language/` files** — canonical defaults consumers inherit (was previously [Unreleased]).
- **`AuditableModelInterface::auditActionName()`** and **`BaseRepository::withAuditAction(string $action)`** — operation-level audit action override (was previously [Unreleased]).

### Fixed

- **`RequestDtoFactory`** auto-resolves `InputValidationService` when not explicitly injected (was previously [Unreleased]).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-08

### Removed (BC break — bump to v0.3.0)
- **All scaffolding code extracted** to the new `dcardenasl/ci4-api-scaffolding` package (`require-dev`). Removed from this package: `src/Commands/`, `src/Generators/`, `src/Orchestration/`, `src/Validators/`, `src/Wiring/`, `src/Config/`, `src/Core/`, and `bin/`. Consumers that call `make:crud`, `make:crud:remove`, or `module:check` must add `dcardenasl/ci4-api-scaffolding: dev-main` to `require-dev` and update `App\Config\Scaffolding.php` to use `dcardenasl\Ci4ApiScaffolding\Config\ScaffoldingConfig` (4.1).
- **`nikic/php-parser`** removed from `require` — it now belongs to `ci4-api-scaffolding`. Production installs of this package no longer pull in the parser library (4.1).
- **`bin/make-crud.sh`** and **`bin/validate-crud.sh`** moved to `ci4-api-scaffolding` (4.1).

### Added
- **`TemplateRenderer`** (`src/Generators/TemplateRenderer.php`) — lightweight template engine that loads `.php.tpl` files from `src/Generators/Templates/` and substitutes `{varName}` placeholders. All 8 built-in generators now delegate output to template files instead of inline heredocs (4.5).
- **19 template files** in `src/Generators/Templates/` — one per generator output (DTOs ×4, migration, entity, model, service ×2, controller ×2, route ×2, language ×2, tests ×3). Changing generated output now produces an explicit diff in the template file, visible in PR review (4.5).
- **17 snapshot tests** in `tests/Unit/Generators/SnapshotTest.php` — assert that each generator's output matches a stored snapshot in `tests/Unit/Generators/__snapshots__/`. A template change that alters generated output will fail CI unless the snapshot is intentionally updated with `--update-snapshots` (4.5).
- **`spatie/phpunit-snapshot-assertions:^5.0`** added to `require-dev` (4.5).
- **`*.tpl text eol=lf`** added to `.gitattributes` to ensure consistent line endings in template files across platforms (4.5).
- **`CrudGeneratorInterface`** (`src/Generators/CrudGeneratorInterface.php`) — formal contract with `name(): string` and `generate(ResourceSchema): array<string,string>`. All 8 built-in generators implement it. Enables plugin architecture: consumers can exclude, replace, or extend the generator set by passing a custom `$generators` list to `ScaffoldingOrchestrator` (4.4).
- **`ScaffoldingOrchestrator::defaultGenerators(ScaffoldingConfig): list<CrudGeneratorInterface>`** — static factory exposing the canonical 8-generator list so callers can filter before constructing. Example: `array_filter($gens, fn($g) => $g->name() !== 'tests')` (4.4).
- **`SyncQueueManager`** (`src/Queue/SyncQueueManager.php`) — drop-in alternative to `QueueManager` that executes `Job::handle()` immediately in the current request. Zero infrastructure requirements; useful in development, testing, and single-server deployments without a queue worker. `$throwOnFailure = true` by default for dev-time visibility; set to `false` to swallow exceptions like the async adapter does (4.10).
- **Coverage reporting in CI** — PHPUnit runs with `--coverage-clover coverage.xml` on PHP 8.2 (xdebug enabled); output is uploaded to Codecov. `phpunit.xml.dist` now has a `<coverage><report><clover>` element (4.8).

### Changed
- **`ScaffoldingOrchestrator` accepts optional `?array $generators`** — when `null` (default), `defaultGenerators($config)` is used. Pass a filtered or extended list to customise the scaffold output without subclassing. **BC compatible** — existing callsites with one argument (`new ScaffoldingOrchestrator($config)`) are unaffected (4.4).
- **`BaseRequestDTO::validate()` requires explicit `ValidationInterface` injection** — the `service('validation')` fallback has been removed. Consumers that instantiate DTOs outside of `RequestDtoFactory` must pass a `ValidationInterface` as the second constructor argument. `RequestDtoFactory` already injects one. **BC break for consumers instantiating DTOs manually without passing validation.** (4.3).
- **`CI PHPUnit step`** — `--coverage-clover coverage.xml` flag added to the PHP 8.2 matrix run (4.8).

### Removed
- **`src/Helpers/request.php`** — procedural wrappers (`require_id`, `require_fields`, `get_int`, `get_bool`, `get_string`, `get_array`, `pick_fields`, `filter_null`, `filter_empty`, `get_pagination_params`) removed. **BC break.** Use `dcardenasl\Ci4ApiCore\Request\RequestHelper::*()` directly (4.3).
- **`request.php` removed from `composer.json` autoload.files`** — no autoload side effect for consumers on upgrade (4.3).

### Added
- **`SearchQueryApplier::sanitizeFulltextQuery(string): string`** — public utility that strips MySQL Boolean Mode operators (`+ - * " ( ) ~ < >`) before a MATCH AGAINST query, preventing user input from altering search semantics silently (R-06).
- **`SecurityContext` constructor validates metadata depth** — values in `$metadata` must be `scalar|null`; nested arrays/objects throw `InvalidArgumentException` at construction time, preventing accidental mutation through reference sharing (R-10).
- **`tests/Unit/Services/Audit/AuditPayloadSanitizerTest`** — 6 test cases covering default redaction, additional fields, nested arrays, and regex pattern matching (R-17).
- **`tests/Unit/Services/Audit/AuditWriterTest`** — 5 test cases covering FK-constraint retry, non-FK re-throw, and non-DatabaseException re-throw (R-17).
- **Security operator sanitization test cases** — `SearchQueryApplierTest` data provider with 10 Boolean Mode operator variants (R-06).
- **SecurityContext mutation tests** — 3 new assertions in `SecurityContextTest` validating scalar-only metadata enforcement (R-10).

### Changed
- **`BaseAuditableModel::initialize()` no longer calls `Services::auditService()`** — audit service is now resolved lazily on the first audit operation via `getAuditService()` (which tries `service('auditService', false)` before throwing). Models that perform no write operations no longer require `auditService` to be registered. Explicit injection via `setAuditService()` still works and takes precedence (R-02).
- **`Auditable::auditBeforeUpdate()` and `auditBeforeDelete()` emit a `log_message('warning', ...)` in non-production** when the N+1 fallback SELECT fires (i.e. `setAuditOldValues()` was not called by the service layer before the operation). In production the fallback is silent to avoid overhead (R-16).
- **`SearchQueryApplier::applyFulltext()`** now calls `sanitizeFulltextQuery()` before `$db->escape()` — eliminates Boolean Mode operator injection without disabling FULLTEXT search (R-06).
- **`phpunit.xml.dist`** — removed stale `Integration` testsuite entry (directory was already moved to `tests/E2E/` in the previous cycle).
- **`EndToEndScaffoldTest` namespace fixed** — changed from `Tests\Integration` to `Tests\E2E` to match the physical location in `tests/E2E/` (3c).
- **`EndToEndScaffoldTest::testGeneratedPhpFilesHaveStrictTypesAndNamespace()`** — new E2E test that uses `nikic/php-parser` to verify every generated class/interface/trait file carries `declare(strict_types=1)` and a named namespace. Catches generator regressions that `php -l` does not (S-04 minimum, 3c).
- **`.github/workflows/ci.yml` PHPUnit step** — `--testsuite Unit,Integration` corrected to `--testsuite Unit` (Integration was removed; E2E already has its own step) (3c).
- **`.github/workflows/ci.yml` `ci4-compatibility` job** — new parallel job running `--testsuite Unit` across PHP 8.2/8.3 × CI4 4.5/4.6/4.7. Uses `composer update` with a pinned CI4 constraint to exercise the `^4.5` declaration without the lock file (3d).

### Removed
- **`ConfigWireman` strrpos fallback** — when the AST editor cannot locate a parseable `trait` declaration in the domain trait file, `WiringFailedException` is thrown with a clear recovery message instead of doing a fragile `strrpos('}')` insertion that breaks on heredocs and PHP 8 attributes. Re-run with `--no-wire` to get the manual snippet (S-01 residual, 3b).
- **`src/Helpers/security.php`** — procedural wrappers (`hash_password`, `verify_password`, `generate_token`, `hash_token`, `generate_api_key`, `hash_api_key`, `generate_uuid`, `constant_time_compare`, `sanitize_filename`, `mask_string`, `mask_email`, `generate_otp`, `is_email_verification_required`) removed. **BC break.** Use the namespaced classes instead: `dcardenasl\Ci4ApiCore\Security\Hasher`, `Token`, `Mask`, and `dcardenasl\Ci4ApiCore\Support\ApiConfigFacade` (R-05).
- **`security.php` removed from `composer.json` autoload.files`** — no autoload side effect for consumers on upgrade (R-05).

### Added
- **`src/Contracts/PaginatableResponse`** — marker interface for paginated DTOs. `ApiResponse::handleDto()` now uses `instanceof PaginatableResponse` instead of key-presence heuristics. **BC break:** custom DTOs that returned `data/total/page/per_page` keys but did not implement this interface will no longer be treated as paginated — implement the interface to restore the behaviour.
- **`PaginatedResponseDTO` implements `PaginatableResponse`** — no behaviour change for existing consumers that use this DTO directly.
- **`LanguageGenerator::checkParity(string $enPath, string $esPath): array`** — compares top-level keys between the `en` and `es` language files for a resource. Returns `missing_in_es` and `missing_in_en` arrays.
- **`ModuleCheck` check #14: language key parity** — reports diverging keys between `en` and `es` language files. Surfaces after manual edits to one file without updating the other.
- **`CorsFilter` static wildcard pattern cache** (`$compiledWildcardPatterns`) — regex patterns for `allowedOrigins` wildcard entries are now compiled once per PHP process instead of on every request.
- **`make:crud:remove --force` flag** — without `--force`, the command now shows a preview of files that will be deleted and asks for confirmation before proceeding. Protects against accidental loss of manually-edited scaffold files. `--force` restores the previous silent-delete behaviour (useful in CI/scripts).
- **`shellcheck` step in CI** — lints `bin/make-crud.sh` and `bin/validate-crud.sh` on every push/PR. `shellcheck` is pre-installed on `ubuntu-latest`.
- **Quick Start section in README** — install + scaffold + validate in three commands, visible immediately after the status badge.
- **`tests/E2E/` suite** — `EndToEndScaffoldTest` moved from `tests/Integration/` to `tests/E2E/`; registered as a separate `E2E` testsuite in `phpunit.xml.dist`. CI runs `Unit,Integration` on every push and `E2E` as a separate step.

### Changed
- **`ExceptionFormatter` uses whitelist instead of blacklist** — `ENVIRONMENT !== 'development'` replaces `ENVIRONMENT === 'production'`. Trace details and verbose messages are now exposed **only** in `development`; any other environment (staging, testing, canary) gets the generic 500 message. Previously, only `production` was protected.
- **`AuditPayloadSanitizer` default fields extracted to `private const DEFAULTS`** — constructor now accepts `$additionalSensitiveFields` (merged with defaults) instead of replacing the full list. **BC break (param rename):** callers using the named argument `$sensitiveFields: [...]` must rename to `$additionalSensitiveFields: [...]`; callers adding extra fields used to have to copy the full default list — now they pass only the extra ones.
- **`ModuleCheck` wiring checks use `preg_match`** — service/mapper/route lookups now tolerate whitespace variations introduced by CS-Fixer (e.g., a space before the opening parenthesis) instead of relying on exact `str_contains` matches.
- **`src/Support/ApiConfigFacade`** — single point of truth for reading `config('Api')` with safe defaults. Replaces three duplicated `apiConfig()` private methods in `SearchQueryApplier`, `QueryBuilder`, and `Searchable`.
- **`src/Support/OperationState` enum** — PHP 8.1 backed enum replacing the `SUCCESS`/`ACCEPTED`/`ERROR` string constants on `OperationResult`. Eliminates silent typo bugs.
- **`src/Contracts/AuditableModelInterface`** — formal contract for auditable models. `BaseRepository::setEntityContext()` now uses `instanceof` instead of `method_exists` duck-typing.
- **`src/Security/Hasher`**, **`src/Security/Token`**, **`src/Security/Mask`** — namespaced replacements for the procedural helpers in `security.php`.
- **`src/Request/RequestHelper`** — namespaced replacement for the procedural helpers in `request.php`.
- **`src/Support/DateHelper`** — namespaced replacement for the procedural helpers in `date.php`.
- **`BaseRequestDTO` accepts `?ValidationInterface $validation`** as optional second constructor parameter. Falls back to `service('validation')` when `null` — backward compatible; enables unit-testing DTOs without a CI4 bootstrap.
- **`RequestDtoFactory::make()` accepts `?ValidationInterface`** as optional third parameter, forwarded to the DTO.

### Changed
- **`OperationResult::$state` type changed from `string` to `OperationState`** — **BC break**. Consumers comparing `$result->state === 'success'` must migrate to `$result->state === OperationState::SUCCESS` (or `$result->state->value === 'success'` as a transitional form). Named factory methods (`success()`, `accepted()`, `error()`) and `isError()`/`isAccepted()` are unaffected.
- **Procedural helpers in `src/Helpers/*.php` are now thin wrappers tagged `@deprecated`**. They delegate to the new namespaced classes and remain backward compatible. They will be removed in v1.0.0.
- **`Auditable::getAuditService()` throws a descriptive `RuntimeException`** (including class name and wiring instructions) instead of the previous language-key lookup when `AuditServiceInterface` is not set.
- **`src/Http/Filters/RequestLoggingFilter`** now reads `requestLoggingEnabled` and `slowQueryThreshold` via `ApiConfigFacade` — fixes a null crash when `Config\Api` is absent.
- **`src/Helpers/security.php` `is_email_verification_required()`** now reads via `ApiConfigFacade` — fixes the same null crash (R-03).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-07

### Added
- **`.gitattributes`** — `export-ignore` rules so Packagist tarballs exclude `tests/`, `docs/`, `.github/`, `.claude/`, config and quality-tool files. Keeps consumer install weight minimal.
- **`SECURITY.md`** — vulnerability disclosure policy and maintainer contact.
- **`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`** — Contributor Covenant 2.1 summary with enforcement contact.
- **`suggest` block in `composer.json`** — `monolog/monolog` and `zircote/swagger-php` are now optional; consumers who don't need JSON logging or OpenAPI generation no longer pull ~3MB of unused deps.
- **`composer security` script** — `composer audit --no-dev --locked`; integrated into `composer quality`.
- **Codecov upload in CI** — coverage report generated on PHP 8.2 is now uploaded via `codecov/codecov-action@v4`; badges added to README.

### Changed
- **`monolog/monolog` and `zircote/swagger-php` moved from `require` to `require-dev`** — present for development and CI; consumers install them explicitly if they use `JsonFormatter`, `MonologHandler`, or OpenAPI generation.
- **`friendsofphp/php-cs-fixer` added to `require-dev`** — previously installed on-demand via a shell guard in `cs-check`/`cs-fix` scripts; now a first-class dev dependency.
- **`composer analyse` now passes `--level=8 --memory-limit=1G` explicitly** — prevents silent level drift if `phpstan.neon` is edited.
- **`composer quality` expanded** — now runs `@analyse`, `@cs-check`, `@security`, and `@test` (previously only `@analyse` + `@test`).
- **CI `Security audit` step** now calls `composer security` (hard-fail) instead of `composer audit` with `continue-on-error: true`.
- **CI PHP CS Fixer step** simplified to `composer cs-check` — no longer needs an inline guard to install the tool.

### Changed (CORE-011, 2026-05-07)
- **PHPStan upgraded from 1.12 to 2.x** (`composer.json`: `phpstan/phpstan: ^1.10` → `^2.0`). Unlocks list types, level 10, and `@phpstan-pure` enforcement. Five real type-safety fixes in flight:
  - `Core/TypeMapper::knownTypes()` and `Http/ApiRequest::setAuthContext()`: removed redundant `array_values()` calls on values already typed as `list<string>` (PHPStan 2.x flags this as `arrayValues.list`).
  - `Models/Auditable::initAuditable()`: removed five `property_exists($this, 'beforeUpdate' | 'beforeDelete' | 'afterInsert' | 'afterUpdate' | 'afterDelete')` checks. The trait is only used by `BaseAuditableModel`, which extends `\CodeIgniter\Model` — those properties are guaranteed by the parent, so the guards were dead code (`function.alreadyNarrowedType` in PHPStan 2.x). Behaviour unchanged.
- **`phpstan.neon` migrated to identifier-based suppressions.** PHPStan 2.x renamed several diagnostics — the "Else branch unreachable because ternary operator condition is always true" message became `instanceof.alwaysTrue`. The suppression for `ApiController`'s defensive ternaries now uses `identifier: instanceof.alwaysTrue` instead of a regex on the human-readable message.
- **New suppression for `trait.unused`** on `Models/Traits/Filterable.php` and `Models/Traits/Searchable.php`. PHPStan 2.x analyses traits only in the context of their users; the package's `src/` has no users (these traits are part of the public API consumed by models in downstream consumer projects), so the package-side analysis correctly reports them as unused. The suppression is documented inline with a link to https://phpstan.org/blog/how-phpstan-analyses-traits

### Changed (CORE-010, 2026-05-07)
- **`phpstan-baseline.neon` removed.** The 71 baseline entries inherited from CORE-002 (port of base classes) are eliminated by adding pragmatic PHPDoc `@param`/`@return` annotations across 13 files in `src/Dto/`, `src/Exceptions/`, `src/Http/`, `src/Models/`, `src/Repositories/`, `src/Services/`, `src/Support/`. Convention: `array<string, mixed>` for free-form payloads, `list<T>` for sequential collections, `array<string, list<string>>` for CI4 validation-error shapes; strict `array{...}` shapes only in `PaginatedResponseDTO::toArray()`, `ApiException::toArray()`, `RepositoryInterface::paginateCriteria()` (return), and `ExceptionFormatter::resolveDebugInfo()`.
- **`phpstan.neon` consolidates the 4 residual suppressions** (Config\App parameter type in `ApiRequest` — required by LSP with `IncomingRequest`; "else branch unreachable" ternaries in `ApiController::getUserId()`/`getUserPermissions()` — defensive guards for framework edge cases despite the `@property ApiRequest $request` annotation). Each entry has an inline comment explaining the rationale.
- **`Auditable::setAuditOldValues()`** now coerces array keys to `string` when normalizing the entity snapshot. CI4's `Model::find()` declares a loose `array<int|string, ...>` return type, but at runtime the keys are always column names; the coercion aligns the trait's storage with the `array<string, mixed>` expected by `AuditServiceInterface::logUpdate()` and `logDelete()`. No behaviour change.

### Added (vanilla-consumer fixes, 2026-05-07)
- **`src/DataCasts/DecimalCast.php`** (B1) — string-backed CI4 DataCast for `DECIMAL` columns. CI4 4.7's native `DataCaster` does not recognize `decimal`, so the previous `ModelEntityGenerator` output crashed (`InvalidArgumentException: No such handler for "price". Invalid type: decimal`) on the first read of any decimal field. The cast preserves precision by round-tripping through `string` (e.g. `'19.99'` in → `'19.99'` out), avoiding the float-rounding bug that `'price' => 'float'` would have introduced. `ModelEntityGenerator` now emits `protected $castHandlers = ['decimal' => DecimalCast::class]` only when the resource has at least one decimal field.
- **`src/Models/Traits/{Filterable,Searchable}.php`** — bundled in core under `dcardenasl\Ci4ApiCore\Models\Traits\`. Generators no longer emit consumer-side `use App\Traits\…` imports, so they work out of the box on any CI4 install.
- **`src/Filters/{FilterParser,FilterOperatorApplier,SearchQueryApplier,QueryBuilder}.php`** — query plumbing for the `Filterable` / `Searchable` traits. `QueryBuilder` typehints `dcardenasl\Ci4ApiCore\Repositories\RepositoryInterface`. `SearchQueryApplier` and `QueryBuilder` read `config('Api')` knobs through a coalescing helper that falls back to safe defaults when the consumer hasn't shipped a `Config\Api` class — so search and pagination paths work out of the box on a vanilla CI4 install.
- **5th runtime contract item** in `CLAUDE.md` documenting the optional `config('Api')` keys (`searchEnabled`, `searchUseFulltext`, `searchMinLength`, `paginationDefaultLimit`, `paginationMaxLimit`) and their default fallbacks.
- **`ScaffoldingConfig::filterableTraitFqcn`** and **`searchableTraitFqcn`** — explicit FQCNs for the Filterable/Searchable traits the model generator emits, defaulting to the bundled core traits. Consumers that prefer their own implementation can override without forking the generator.

### Fixed (vanilla-consumer fixes, 2026-05-07)
- **`ConfigWireman::registerDomainInMainServices()`** (G1) — when the consumer's `Config/Services.php` is a clean CI4 install (`class Services extends BaseService` with no prior `require_once '/...DomainServices.php';` and no prior `use ...DomainServices;`), the regex-only injection silently fell through and `verifyMainServicesRegistration()` threw `WiringFailedException` after every artifact had already been written. Added two fallback anchors: when no sibling `require_once` exists, inject before `class Services extends \w+`; when no sibling `use ...DomainServices;` exists, inject after the class opening `{`. Truly malformed `Services.php` files (no `class Services extends X` declaration at all) still fail loudly via the post-write guard.
- **`Generators\TestGenerator::featureTestTemplate()`** (G3) — pre-fix the template extended `Tests\Support\ApiTestCase` (a starter-only helper) and hardcoded `assertStatus(401)` (only valid when the route group includes `jwtauth`). Now extends `\CodeIgniter\Test\CIUnitTestCase` directly with `DatabaseTestTrait` + `FeatureTestTrait`, and the asserted status is derived from `protectedRouteFilters`: `jwtauth`/`auth`/`appKeyRequired` → 401, otherwise 404.
- **`Generators\ModelEntityGenerator`** (B2) — first key (`'id' => 'integer'`) of the generated `$casts = [...]` array now matches the indentation of subsequent keys. Purely cosmetic but jarring in vanilla consumers without a `cs-fix` script.

### Changed
- **BREAKING — package renamed** (CORE-001, 2026-05-07): `dcardenasl/ci4-api-crud-maker` → `dcardenasl/ci4-api-core`. PSR-4 namespace migrated from `dcardenasl\CI4ApiCrudMaker\` to `dcardenasl\Ci4ApiCore\`. Repository URL updated to `https://github.com/dcardenasl/ci4-api-core`. Consumers must update their `composer.json` `require` entry, `repositories` URL/path, and any `use dcardenasl\CI4ApiCrudMaker\...` imports.

### Added
- **`.github/workflows/ci.yml`** (audit B5.4, 2026-05-06) — first CI/CD pipeline for the package. Matrix on PHP 8.2 / 8.3 with `composer validate --strict`, `composer install`, PHP CS-Fixer dry-run, PHPStan analyse, PHPUnit, and `composer audit` (soft-fail). Closes the "Composer package shipping without automated tests" CRITICAL gap from the May 2026 audit.
- **`.github/dependabot.yml`** (audit B5.4) — weekly Composer + GitHub Actions dependency updates with `chore(deps)` / `chore(ci)` commit prefixes.
- **`.php-cs-fixer.dist.php`** (audit B5.4) — strict ruleset (`@PSR12`, `declare_strict_types`, `strict_comparison`, `void_return`, `ordered_imports`, `array_syntax=short`).
- **`CLAUDE.md`** + **`TASKS.md`** (audit B6.3) — onboarding and canonical task tracker.
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** (audit B6.3) — branching, PR checklist, release flow, quality gates, architecture pointers.
- **`composer.json` script aliases** — `cs-check`, `cs-fix`, `quality` (alias for `analyse + test`).
- **`docs/adr/0001-flat-crud-only-in-v0x.md`** (audit B6.4) — first Architecture Decision Record. Documents why relation-aware generation (`hasMany`/`belongsTo` accessors, embedded Response DTOs, nested routes) is intentionally out of scope for v0.x and the triggers that would unlock a v0.3 redesign.
- **README "Scope and limitations" section** + **CLAUDE.md "Scope: flat CRUD only"** (audit B6.4) — explicit list of what `fk:<table>` does today vs. what consumers must hand-wire.

### Changed
- **PHPStan raised level 5 → level 8** (audit B6.1, 2026-05-06). Three legitimate type-safety issues fixed in flight (no baseline needed):
  - `src/Validators/ForeignKeyValidator.php`: explicit null-guard inside the loop (the `array_filter` closure already excludes null `fkTable`, but PHPStan can't narrow through closures).
  - `src/Wiring/ConfigWireman.php`: `preg_replace(...) ?? $content` to handle the documented `string|null` return on regex-engine errors. Behaviour unchanged in the happy path.
- **`composer.lock`** is now **committed** (audit B6.2). Removes "lock not up to date" warnings from `composer validate --strict` and gives CI reproducible installs across the matrix.
- **`composer.json`**: `analyse` script no longer hardcodes `--level=5` (level lives in `phpstan.neon`).
- **`.gitignore`**: `composer.lock` removed; `.php-cs-fixer.cache` added.
- **`ScaffoldingConfig::defaults()` default permission** changed from `permission:iam.admin-access` (deprecated) to `permission:iam.superadmin-access`. New scaffolds are reachable by superadmins only by default — secure-by-default. Loosen per-resource by editing the generated route file or by overriding `protectedRouteFilters` in the consumer's `App\Config\Scaffolding`.
- **`ConfigWireman::wire()`** verifies after each injection step (require_once + use trait + service factory) and throws `WiringFailedException` carrying the manual recovery snippet via `describe()`. The spark command catches this and prints the snippet — consumers no longer end up with half-wired modules when their `Services.php` layout doesn't match the expected pattern.
- **`ForeignKeyValidator::validate()`** is **strict by default** when the database is unreachable AND the schema declares FK fields. Set `skipOnDbUnreachable: true` (or pass `make:crud --skip-fk-validation`) to fall back to the historical "warn and continue" behavior.
- **`bin/validate-crud.sh`** derives the table name from `StringHelper::pluralize()` (PHP) instead of the naive `${RESOURCE%y}` bash trick. Resources with irregular plurals (`Person → People`, `Goose → Geese`) and same-prefix neighbors (`User` vs `UserRole`) now resolve to the correct migration file on the first match.
- **`RouteGenerator::injectRoute()`** asserts all 5 CRUD route lines (`index`, `show`, `create`, `update`, `delete`) appear in the output and throws otherwise — catches template regressions or cases where the injection target pattern matched but the resulting concatenation truncated the block.
- **`ScaffoldRemover`** now reports orphan controller references in the `warnings` key of its return shape. When the user hand-edited the routes file with custom routes for the same controller, the standard regex strip can't safely remove them; the remover surfaces "manual cleanup required" guidance instead of leaving the file in an undefined state.

- **`tests/Integration/EndToEndScaffoldTest.php`** (audit B6.5) — first end-to-end integration test for the package. Runs `ScaffoldingOrchestrator->orchestrate()` against the temp APPPATH/ROOTPATH from `tests/bootstrap.php`, asserts at least 13 artifacts produced, runs `php -l` syntax check on every generated `.php` file, validates conventional paths, and asserts the idempotency contract (re-running raises `ScaffoldConflictException`). 3 tests / 48 assertions. Catches cross-generator regressions (template forward references, namespace drift, missing imports) that single-generator unit tests miss. **Deferred to v0.3:** a richer fixture that boots a real CI4 app with DB+migrations+HTTP — the cheap version above catches most plantilla regressions at ~1% of the cost.

### Fixed
- **2 pre-existing style violations** auto-fixed when the strict CS-Fixer config was adopted (audit B5.4):
  - `src/Generators/ControllerGenerator.php:118` — added space in `fn ($f) =>`.
  - `tests/Unit/Generators/ControllerGeneratorTest.php:8` — removed unused `ScaffoldingPaths` import.

### Added
- **`Wiring\WiringFailedException`** — carries the manual recovery snippet plus `describe()` helper for nice CLI rendering.
- **`Validators\UnknownFieldTypeException`** — thrown by `FieldStringParser::parse()` when a field declares an unknown type code (e.g. typo `intenger` instead of `int`). Lists known types in the exception message; previously `TypeMapper::get()` silently fell back to `string`, generating a wrong-type column.
- **`TypeMapper::isKnown()` / `TypeMapper::knownTypes()`** — public helpers used by the parser; surface the type whitelist for tooling.
- **`make:crud --skip-fk-validation`** flag — opts out of the new strict FK check when running on a dev machine without Docker / DB up.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-03

### Added
- Package skeleton: `composer.json`, `src/` tree, `tests/` tree, `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `.gitignore`, PHPUnit and PHPStan config.
- Framework-agnostic core: `Core\StringHelper`, `Core\Field`, `Core\ResourceSchema`, `Core\TypeMapper`, `Core\Fqcn`.
- `Validators\FieldStringParser`, `Validators\FieldNameValidator`, `Validators\ForeignKeyValidator` — field string parsing and upfront rejection of PHP keywords, MySQL reserved words, and audit columns.
- `Config\BaseScaffoldingConfig` — abstract base the consumer's `App\Config\Scaffolding` extends; `build()` returns a fully-typed `ScaffoldingConfig` so renames surface as IDE errors.
- `Config\ScaffoldingConfig` + `Config\ScaffoldingPaths` — value objects centralizing every consumer-side convention (base classes, paths, route filters, app namespace). Zero hardcoded `App\…` references in generators.
- `Generators\{Dto,Migration,ModelEntity,Service,Controller,Route,Language,Test}Generator` — all 8 generators accepting `ScaffoldingConfig` via constructor.
- `Orchestration\ScaffoldingOrchestrator` — coordinates the 8 generators, validates case-insensitive collisions, rolls back on partial failure.
- `Orchestration\ScaffoldRemover` — inverse operation; all file-path computations sourced from `ScaffoldingPaths`.
- `Orchestration\ScaffoldConflictException`.
- `Wiring\ConfigWireman` — regex-based injection into `app/Config/Services.php` and per-domain trait files. Adds `previewWiring()` for `--no-wire` consumers.
- `Commands\MakeCrud`, `MakeCrudRemove`, `ModuleCheck` — three CI4 spark commands; fall back to `ScaffoldingConfig::defaults()` with a warning if `Config\Scaffolding` is absent.
- `bin/make-crud.sh` and `bin/validate-crud.sh` distributed via Composer `bin`; auto-locate project root, forward `--no-wire`.
- Unit test suite: 47 tests / 160 assertions, all green. PHPStan level 5 clean.
- `docs/CRUD_FROM_ZERO.md` — step-by-step scaffold playbook.
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE_CONTRACT.md` — non-negotiable layer rules for generated modules.
